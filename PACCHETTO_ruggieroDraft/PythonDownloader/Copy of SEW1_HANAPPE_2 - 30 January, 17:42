Structure 1:
* We designed an inexpensive phenotyping station.
* With the help of this phenotyping station we scanned the Arabidopsis thaliana and extracted the angles and the length of the internodes between successive siliques on the main stem.
* We compared the computed angles against the manual measurements.
* We evaluated the processing pipeline against data of virtual plant using a computational model of A. thaliana.
* With of the help of this solution, we can now automate the analysis of the phyllotaxy of large sets plants.  
* This large dataset is need to study the link between genetic variation and traits in the phyllotaxy.  


Structure 2:
* The shape of a plant is influenced by the biological processes in the plant and by external, environmental factors. 
* A precise observation of the plant’s shape may provide information on the plant’s health or on its environment.  … [This is too far fetched because we don’t have any data yet to back this up.]
* …


Structure 3:
* The shape of a plant is influenced by the biological processes in the plant and by external, environmental factors. 
* For example, the position of the flowers on the shoot of the Arabidopsis thaliana is closely related the hormone signaling and the concentration of auxin in the meristem.
* We want to understand whether variations in the phyllotaxis are due to genetic expressions or to other factors.
* However, it is necessary to measure a large set of plants.
* To undertake this study, we need an automatic and inexpensive phenotyping station.
* We therefore built such a phenotyping station using off-the-shelf components and open source software.
* We developed data processing pipeline that takes a series of images of a single plant as input and provides the list of angles and internode lengths as output.
* We have compared the results with manual measurements.
* We have evaluated each step of the pipeline on a series of synthesis images that was produced using a computational model of A. thaliana.
* The phenotyping station creates new opportunities for researchers who have to analyse large sets of plants using a limited budget.   
* The phenotyping station creates new opportunities for also for professionals who would like to introduce 3D screening of their plants in their work flow.
