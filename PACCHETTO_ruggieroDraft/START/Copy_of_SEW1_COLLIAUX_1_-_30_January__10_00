Robotics is envisioned as a revolution for the coming years impacting work conditions as well as our daily life. It is also announce as a major factor in bringing a new green revolution to the agriculture sector. Some argue that it will be much needed  for facing the challlenge of feeding 9 billion people by 2050. 


Recent years have seen the emergence of robots dedicated to various tasks in agriculture. Often, these are big machines as working in fields require a robust setup and high power and they are dedicated to a single culture. The agroequipment sector have to make few adjustments to get their traditional machines autonomous but it is a continuation of the technology they used to produce.


We also see a different approach to the problem with projects focusing on lightweight platforms with modular architecture. These are interesting in many ways and could provide the basis of a much more radical change in agricultural practices. Of course, having small robots may not seem efficient to cover the wide areas of today’s farmers but some projects propose to combine several of these robots working in cooperation. Also, a small robot is of great interest for microfarms
