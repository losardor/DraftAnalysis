In a recent interview, Tim Barners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, said: “for many years there was a feeling that the wonderful things on the web were going to dominate and we’d have a world with less conflict, more understanding, more and better science, and good democracy”. Nowadays, instead, “humanity connected by technology on the web is functioning in a dystopian way. We have online abuse, prejudice, bias, polarisation, fake news, there are lots of ways in which it is broken.”
