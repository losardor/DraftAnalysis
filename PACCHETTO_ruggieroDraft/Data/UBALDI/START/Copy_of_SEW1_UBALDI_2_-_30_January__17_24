Modelling modern socio-technical systems as creative processes.


Modern socio-technical systems are inherently complex and so is their dynamical evolution. Indeed, their are composed by a large number of elements interacting at different temporal and spatial time scales. For example, the mobility pattern of a city may be affected by road conditions or particular events happening in certain neighborhoods. In the same way, our social network evolves in an unpredictable way when we meet a new person or we change our routine. The study and understanding of the functioning this class of system is then a challenging task that ca


Models are not catching the underlying complexity/mechanisms.


Propose a new modelling framework: experiences, series of exploration, innovation, local/global dynamics.


Current results are encouraging: different systems (mobility, music exploration etc.) but same concept applies.


Challenges: unknown structure of space, difficult evaluation and validation in field.


Future directions: insert the forecast, include perturbations and disruptures, make it predictive and accountable for policy making.
