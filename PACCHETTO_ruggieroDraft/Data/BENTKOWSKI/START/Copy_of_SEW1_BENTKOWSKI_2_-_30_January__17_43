When Charles Darwin laid out the foundation of the theory of evolution for the first time, it was still unknown what is the agent of inheritance and how variation emerges in the populations. It was not until XX years later when the concept of a gene was proposed and a discovery was made that these genes are embedded in the sequence of monomers of the desoxyribonucleic acid polymers - the DNA. Since then science has made a huge effort to understand how DNA sequences influence the shapes and forms of life that can be subjected to the natural selection described by Darwin so well. 


And these efforts have shown a world of unimaginable complexity. The path from molecular structure of a DNA passage to, say, length of a bird’s beak involves a large number of intermediate steps: first fragments of DNA (which are rather large molecules) have to be re-written into a more handy piece of information - the mRNA molecule small enough to be conveniently moved around the cell. But mRNAs are not a one-to-one copies of their templates. Eukaryotic genes are divided into small number of pieces called introns that code for something and exons that are ‘just’ spacers. The process of assembling a mature mRNA is called splicing and it can be done in a number of alternative ways. One piece of DNA can produce more similar, bu not identical forms of mRNA. And after this come other question
