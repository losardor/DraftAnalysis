The interaction between pathogen strains and its effect on the population level spread of diseases is raising increasing attention nowadays. This is because such interactions have been found to have an effect on the spreading dynamics of infectious diseases and on the efficacy of interventions. Influenza subtypes, for instance, have a different impact on the population, thus their heterogeneous properties must be accounted for in the planning of interventions and design of vaccination. For bacterial infections such as pneumococco, developed vaccine targeting only one subset of strain may cause strain replacement.  examples ... of interventions.

The central question is about understanding the drivers of pathogen diversity


The difficulty is due to the accounting of the many biological and population drivers of emergence. In particular population
