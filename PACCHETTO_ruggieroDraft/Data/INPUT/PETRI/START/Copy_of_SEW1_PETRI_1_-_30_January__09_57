Artificial intelligence is the new gold. Companies are rushing to hire young talented deep learning wizards. Universities furiously restructure their teaching offer to include courses on any flavour of machine learning. Computer science conferences 


* AI and neuroscience. Lots of hype recently about the advances of artificial intelligence, its applications, its benefits and its risks. 
* Power/benefits etc. At the core of it all, there is the idea that the machines might one day emulate if not surpass our capacity to understand, plan and potentially change the world. 


* Emergence of At the same time, almost unseen, an arcane branch of mathematics started making its way into the arenas of machine learning, data science and -also- AI. 
* Topology and its successes
* What is topology? It is based on simple ideas o f
