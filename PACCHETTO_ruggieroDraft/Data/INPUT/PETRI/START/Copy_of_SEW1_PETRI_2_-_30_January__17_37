AI started a new gold rush. It is causing huge changes in industry, academia and in society. Companies rush to hire young deep-learning wizards. Universities restructure their courses to include all types of machine learning. Traditionally boring computer science conferences revamp themselves into dazzling shows of disruptive applications to societal challenges. 


It wasn’t always the case. The current AI renaissance follows decades of slow development and rides on the wave of the explosion of computing power and availability of large annotated datasets. These finally allowed neural networks to reach human-level performances in tasks, such as driving a car, planning a path through a crowded station and -importantly- recognize fluffy cats in photographs. 


At its roots, however, AI was about a far older and fundamental question: what is the origin of human intelligence? And, can we reconstruct it? 


With recent developments, AI applications finally provide a window into how our brain might work. 


Both brains and machines seems to encode space and relations in similar ways


This encoding is topological in nature and this is surprising…  because topology is very rarefied and arcane.


Other functions (memory, tasks) share similarities with spatial coding. 


Therefore, they are likely to be topologically encoded too.
