Modelling modern socio-technical systems as creative processes.


Modern socio-technical systems are inherently complex and so is their dynamical evolution. Indeed, their are composed by a large number of elements interacting at different temporal and spatial time scales. For example, the mobility pattern of a city may be affected by road conditions or particular events happening in certain neighborhoods. In the same way, our social network evolves in an unpredictable way when we meet a new person or we change our routine. To understand the functioning of these systems is a challenging task that we can now tackle thanks to the large availability of digital logs recording many context of human activity.


Despite this wealth of data, attempts to describe such systems proposed so far are not catching the underlying mechanisms shaping the structure and dynamics of socio-technical systems. Some 


Propose a new modelling framework: experiences, series of exploration, innovation, local/global dynamics.


Current results are encouraging: different systems (mobility, music exploration etc.) but same concept applies.


Challenges: unknown structure of space, difficult evaluation and validation in field.


Future directions: insert the forecast, include perturbations and disruptures, make it predictive and accountable for policy making.
