Modelling modern socio-technical systems as creative processes.


Modern systems are complex.


Models are not catching the underlying complexity/mechanisms.


Propose a new modelling framework: experiences, series of exploration, innovation, local/global dynamics.


Current results are encouraging: different systems (mobility, music exploration etc.) but same concept applies.


Challenges: unknown structure of space, difficult evaluation and validation in field.


Future directions: insert the forecast, include perturbations and disruptures, make it predictive and accountable for policy making.
