Towards novelty-driven recommender systems




We get recommendations about everything and in a pervasive way. We get books recommended, music recommended, food recommended, items to buy, hotels, trips. Even ideas. We are so used to receive suggestions and tips and in a way or another we constantly ground our decisions on the constant flux of stimuli we receive or we seek for. The entanglement of our behaviours with the technology powering recommender systems is so strong that perhaps we don’t even remember how was our life before any recommendation was .
