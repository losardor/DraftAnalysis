Recommender systems are ubiquitous in our  everyday experience. We receive recommendations about new books, new songs, new items to buy, hotels, restaurant, trips. Even opinions and ideas. Recommendations are so entangled in our experience that perhaps we cannot even conceive our life without them. Still we base most of our decisions on the suggestions or tips we receive or seek for. 


Recommendations typically concern something we may like because it is similar to something we liked in our past experience or it is similar to something liked by someone else with a personal history similar to ours. Either way, recommendations tend to confine us in a sort of comfort zone, circularly defined as the set of items we tend to perceive as close to our taste or sensibility. They hardly suggest to us to explore something radically new. If this seems desirable in a marketing environment to fidelise the customers, it  risks to reduce our open-mindedness, preventing us from experiencing conflicting views and make up our minds.
