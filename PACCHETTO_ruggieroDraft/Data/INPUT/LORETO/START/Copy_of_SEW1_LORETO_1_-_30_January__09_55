We are so used to receive suggestions and tips and in a way or another we constantly ground our decisions on the constant flux of stimuli we receive or we seek for. The entanglement of our behaviours with the technology powering recommender systems is nowadays so strong that perhaps we cannot even conceive our life without them.

Two users can be similar if they went through similar experiences. Two items can be similar because they share some structural, functional or semantic features. Two items can be similar also if they were experienced by
