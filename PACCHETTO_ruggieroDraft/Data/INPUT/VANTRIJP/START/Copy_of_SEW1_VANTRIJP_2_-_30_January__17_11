Chopping Down the Syntax Tree 
(version 2)


If Noam Chomsky’s Visiting Martian would travel back to earth to catch up with the latest developments, they would be intrigued by a new species of language researchers: construction grammarians. Construction grammarians come in all shapes and sizes, but they all agree on the idea that all linguistic information can be represented by a single data structure: constructions. This idea revolutionizes how we conceive of the human language capacity: no more separation between words and syntax, no more distinction between rules and exceptions, and no more need to split up language into different modules. But what exactly is a construction and what can it do?


A first striking behavior among construction grammarians is that they tend to avoid to use tree structures for analyzing sentences that other linguists love so much.
