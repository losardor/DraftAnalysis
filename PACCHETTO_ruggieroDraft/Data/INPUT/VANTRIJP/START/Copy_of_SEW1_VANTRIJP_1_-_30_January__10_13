Unfortunately, construction grammarians are also furtive creatures who have been reluctant to offer precise definitions for their most important data structure, but this would only further arouse the Visiting Martian’s interest. It should also interest us: understanding what constructions can do is more than a matter of intergalactic anthropology, as it may completely change the way we understand the linguistic capacity of humans.


We find our Visiting Martian at the Place des Vosges, one of the most peaceful squares in the city of Paris, 


The first striking behavior of construction grammarians is that they avoid to use tree diagrams that other linguists seem to love so much. Our Visiting Martian is contemplating this question while taking a rest at the Place des Vosges, one of the most peaceful
