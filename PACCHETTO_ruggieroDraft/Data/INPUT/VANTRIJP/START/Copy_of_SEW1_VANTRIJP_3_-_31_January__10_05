Chopping Down the Syntax Tree 
(version 3)


Noam Chomsky revolutionized the field of linguistics in the 1950s, but is now facing to be dethroned himself. In the Chomskyan view, the human language faculty is an autonomous, genetically encoded “perfect system” that interfaces with other mental modules (Chomsky 1995). In the past few decades, however, a new paradigm has emerged that rejects this modular approach and that treats language as an integral part of cognition and as a culturally evolved instrument for social interaction. 


The grammatical theory that embodies this new paradigm the most is called construction grammar. Construction grammars exist in different flavors, but they all agree that all linguistic information can be represented using a single data structure: constructions. Unfortunately, construction grammarians have been reluctant to offer a precise definition of what a construction is. Instead, they informally describe their most important data structure as “any mapping between meaning and form”. 


This lack of formal rigour invites linguists to recycle the formal tools that were developed within mainstream linguistics, or even to abandon formalization completely.


In order to propose a computationally precise definition of a construction, it is useful to first examine why the formal tools of mainstream linguistics are inadequate for constructional analyses.
