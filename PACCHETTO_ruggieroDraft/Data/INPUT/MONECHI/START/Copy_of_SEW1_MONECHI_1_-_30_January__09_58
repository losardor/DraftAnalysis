One of the biggest challenges humanity is facing nowadays is the speeding up of  the urbanization phenomenon. Despite the recent inversion of the trend in some areas of the world after the economic crisis, the vast majority of population for the first time in history now resides in cities. Different communities within science has started to tackle the problem of building a deep understanding of the phenomena related with urban environment, with the aim of building more sustainable and liveable cities. 


In relatively recent years, complex systems modelling allowed for the understanding of general laws governing the structure of cities at a microscopic level. It has been shown, that when considering cities at an aggregated level, i.e. the level of macroscopic socio-economic indicators, scaling-laws emerge. In other words, each socio-economic indicator scales with a power of the population and this phenomenon occurs disregarding the specific part of the world and the specific.


These simple laws has profound consequences in the way we think cities. Scaling-laws indicates similar properties at each scale, so that we can think smaller cities to be made of the same basic components of larger one occurring on a different scale. Such intriguing idea has been backed up in time by empirical observations as well as different modelling schemes, trying to grasp the microscopic mechanism making scalings emerge. Moreover, it has been backed up by th
