When the theory of evolution was first proposed in the mid 19th century little was known about the source of the inheritance and variability of individuals that were the principal concepts upon which natural selection could act. Discovery of genes and that they are embedded in the sequence of monomers in an organic polymer came much later.

Every inheritable trait has its roots in genes, whether it is citric acid degradation by an enzyme or the length of bird’s beak. Experimenting with biological evolution it is difficult, expensive and time-consuming (see Lenski’s long-ruunning experiment on Escherichia coli evolution). One may wish to model these processes first. But conceptualising from DNA molecules to phenotypic traits upon which natural selection can act is challenging.
One of the most interesting problems that illustrate the need to work out the way how to link molecular mechanism to natural selection on population level is the case of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. MHCs are a class of proteins found in all vertebrates responsible for detection and presentation to the immune system of foreign peptides thus protecting an animal against a vast array of pathogens: from viruses to skin parasites. In the recent decades it has been shown that they are not only selected based on their anti-pathogen capabilities, but also are subjected to the sexual selection.
The problem is that the immune responses are one of the most complicated mechanisms found in biology! Implementing the whole system, with DNA-to-RNA transcription with alternative splicing, ensemble of proteins from number of peptide chains, docking of the foreign peptide, docking the T-cell receptors… one need to simplify.




… and then to put to the test in the lab.
