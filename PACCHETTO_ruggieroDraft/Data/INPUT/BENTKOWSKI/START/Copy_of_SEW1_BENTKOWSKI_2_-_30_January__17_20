When Charles Darwin laid out the foundation of the theory of evolution for the first time it was still unknown what is the agent of inheritance and how variation emerges in the populations. It was not until 20th century when the concept of a gene was proposed and a discovery was made that these genes are embedded in the sequence of monomers in the chain of ribonucleic acid polymers.
