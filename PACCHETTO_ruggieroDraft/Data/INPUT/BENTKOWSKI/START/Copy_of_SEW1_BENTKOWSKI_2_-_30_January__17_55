The theory of biological evolution is based on three fundamental concepts: inheritance, variation in offspring and selection. A very clean thus very intellectually attractive conceptual framework. But when Charles Darwin laid out the foundations of natural selection, that are widely accepted even today, it was still unknown what is the agent of inheritance and how variation emerges in populations. It was not until XX years later when the concept of a gene was proposed and a discovery was made that these genes are embedded in the sequence of monomers of the desoxyribonucleic acid polymers - the DNA. Since then science has made a huge effort to understand how DNA sequences influence the shapes and forms of life that can be subjected to the natural selection described by Darwin so well. 


Studying evolution in troublesome task. 


And later efforts have shown a world of unimaginable complexity. The path from molecular structure of a DNA passage to, say, length of a bird’s beak involves a large number of intermediate steps: first, the fragments of DNA (which are rather large molecules) have to be re-written into a more handy piece of information - the mRNA molecule small enough to be conveniently moved around the cell. But mRNAs are not a one-to-one copies of their templates. Eukaryotic genes are divided into small number of pieces called introns that code for something and exons that are ‘just’ spacers. The process of assembling a mature mRNA is called splicing and it can be done in a number of alternative ways omitting some introns and including others. One piece of DNA can produce a number of similar, but not identical forms of mRNA. And after this come other complications: chemical stability thus longevity of mRNA, how they are moved around
