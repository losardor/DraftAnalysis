When Charles Darwin laid out the foundation of the theory of evolution for the first time it was still unknown what is the agent of inheritance and how variation emerges in the populations. It was not until XX years later century when the concept of a gene was proposed and a discovery was made that these genes are embedded in the sequence of monomers in the chain of desoxyribonucleic acid polymers - the DNA. Since then science has made huge effort to understand how DNA sequences influence the shapes and forms of life that can be subjected to the natural selection described by Darwin so well.
