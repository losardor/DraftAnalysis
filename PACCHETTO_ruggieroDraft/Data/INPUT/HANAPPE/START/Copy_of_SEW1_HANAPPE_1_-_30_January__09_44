The shape of a plant can give you insights into the biological processes that steer its growth. These processes depend on numerous factors, some specific to the plant such as its genetic material and some external to the plant such environmental conditions. A plant that has been studied extensively is the Arabidopsis thaliana. When the young plant first grows a rosetta of leaves. When it goes into flowering
