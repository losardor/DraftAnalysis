The shape of a plant can give you insights into the biological processes that steer its growth. These processes depend on numerous factors, some specific to the plant such as its genetic material and some external to the plant such environmental conditions. A plant that has been studied extensively is the Arabidopsis thaliana. When the young plant first grows a rosetta of leaves. When it goes into flowering its stems shoot up and flowers and fruits develop around the stem in a (mostly) spiral organisation. Between each flower there is a small stem and successive flowers are positioned at different horizontal angles. On average, the angle between them is 137 degrees. 


This arrangement of the fruits along the stem, also called its phyllotaxis,
