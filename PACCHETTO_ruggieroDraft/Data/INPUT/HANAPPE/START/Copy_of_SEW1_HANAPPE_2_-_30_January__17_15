Structure 1:
* We designed an inexpensive phenotyping station.
* With the help of this phenotyping station we scanned the Arabidopsis thaliana and extracted the angles and the length of the internodes between successive siliques on the main stem.
* We compared the computed angles against the manual measurements.
* We evaluated the processing pipeline against data of virtual plant using a computational model of A. thaliana.
* With of the help of this solution, we can now automate the analysis of the phyllotaxy of large sets plants.  
* This large dataset is need to study the link between genetic variation and traits in the phyllotaxy.
