The need for AI based interactive tools for music composition




Nowadays, artificial intelligence has opened exciting perspectives in various domains such as artistic creation. Indeed, we have now reached a point where machine learning models are able of producing realistic and touching work of art as shown by the example of The Next Rembrandt, a project led by Delft university aiming at creating a totally new painting in the style of the famous Dutch painter with the help of AI. While being increasingly used for visual art, music is still lacking that new technologic layer.


However, musicians and composers have already came a long way from the tribal rhythms, gregorian chants or middle age musical stories. At that time, musical traditions were transmitted orally, which is not the case anymore since the development of theories on how to write music.
