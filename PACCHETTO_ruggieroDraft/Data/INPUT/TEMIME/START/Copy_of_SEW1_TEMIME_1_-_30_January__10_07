Due to a widespread iatrogenic contamination in the 1960’s, Egypt currently has the highest hepatitis C (HCV) prevalence worldwide, with up to 30% seropositivity in individuals over 50. It is thought that hospitals play a major part in sustaining the current epidemic dynamics. Indeed, hospitalized patients undergo a high number of invasive procedures during which they are at risk of acquiring HCV, all the more so that compliance with infection control recommendations is not perfect. This risk is increased by the fact that the prevalence is particularly high among patients admitted to hospitals, due to their age and medical history. 
Hence, controlling the epidemic of HCV in Egypt requires the control of transmission within hospitals. However, in order to propose strategies to improve this control, a better understanding of HCV spreading dynamics within hospitals is needed. In this context, my research program aims at developing tools to model hospital HCV transmission in Egypt, based on epidemiological data, and using these tools to identify targets for control strategies and assess these strategies.
Mathematical models are a useful tool in epidemiology, to better understand infection spread, propose and assess control strategies, and predict future dynamics. Within healthcare settings, they have been used extensively in the last decades to study the spread of (often resistant) bacterial pathogens, as well as viruses such as influenza or Ebola. Models of HCV spread within the general Egyptian population have also been developed to estimate its epidemic potential in future years. However, no model of HCV spreading dynamics within hospitals has ever been developed. The project I envision
