Controlling and containing the epidemic diffusion is an important  healthcare challenge worldwide. Nowadays, by the increasing of the transport network, especially  air network,  people moves easier all over the world. It involves  more complexity in individual fluxes and, therefore, it means that the understanding of the spatial propagation of pathogens in more complicated. In this scenario, modeling the epidemic spreading a global level is an ever-evolving challenge. The principal drivers of the epidemic spreading are the subpopulations structures ( e.i. geography area), mobility and social interactions
