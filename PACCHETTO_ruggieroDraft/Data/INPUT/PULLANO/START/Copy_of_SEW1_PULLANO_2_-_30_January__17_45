Controlling and containing the epidemic diffusion is an important  healthcare challenge worldwide, in fact many times people from over the world have been affected by devastating epidemic. Modeling the epidemic spreading identifying the key features of the epidemic propagation is an ever-evolving challenge.  The principal drivers of the epidemic spreading are the subpopulations structures ( e.i. geography, age), human mobility and social interactions, and quite often these are intercorrelated. Nowadays, by the increasing of the transport network, especially  air network,  people moves easier all over the world. It involves  more complexity in individual fluxes and it means that understanding the spatial and temporal propagation of pathogens is becoming always more complicated. E
