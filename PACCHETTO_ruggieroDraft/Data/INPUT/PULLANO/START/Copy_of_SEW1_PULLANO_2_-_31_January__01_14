Infectious diseases are the second leading cause of death in the world, in the history many times people from over the world have been affected by devastating epidemic that had destroyed both the social and economic environment. Therefore, controlling and containing the epidemic diffusion is an important  healthcare challenge worldwide.  


Nowadays, by the increasing of the travels and urbanization,  people moves easier and more frequently. The growing complexity of the individual fluxes involves  more difficult on the understanding of the spatial and temporal propagation of pathogens. Therefore, the modelisation of the epidemic spreading to  identify the key mechanisms of the spread  is always an ever-evolving challenge.In fact, Public Health institutions needs epidemic surveillance and modeling  plan and evaluate targeting strategies to prevent or contain outbreaks.


 It was proven that principal drivers of the epidemic spreading are the subpopulations structures ( e.i. geography or social structures), the human mobility and  the social interactions. Collecting this kind of  informations about human behaviors, it is not that easy, especially in developing countries where the mobility is highly heterogeneous. 


Mobile phone data has recently offer the opportunity to sense individual behaviours in many aspect of daily life. It have been one of the fastest technologies over the last decade, reaching both urban and rural populations. Mobile phone data are collected by telephone companies, basically a Call Detail Record (CDR) is generated every time that an user makes a call or texts a message.
