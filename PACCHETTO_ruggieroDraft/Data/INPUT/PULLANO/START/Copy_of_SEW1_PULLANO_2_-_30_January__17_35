Controlling and containing the epidemic diffusion is an important  healthcare challenge worldwide. Nowadays, by the increasing of the transport network, especially  air network,  people moves easier all over the world. It involves  more complexity in individual fluxes and it means that understanding the spatial and temporal propagation of pathogens is becoming always more complicated. Modeling the epidemic spreading identifying the key features of the epidemic propagation of an emerging outbreak ois an ever-evolving challenge. The principal drivers of the epidemic spreading are the subpopulations structures ( e.i. geography, age), human mobility and social interactions, and quite often these are intercorrelated. Therefore, the
