Controlling  and containing epidemics is an important healthcare challenge worldwide. Nowadays, people easily can move from different countries and human fluxes are coming increasingly complex and heterogeneous, it makes easier the propagations of pathogens all over the world. In this scenario, approaches that can surveille subpopulations movement are critical for enhancing containment and mitigation processes. Modeling epidemic diffusion for unraveling the features that are involved in the epidemic spreading is an ever-evolving challenge. It been proved that population structures, mobility and social interactions are the key drivers of the epidemics and this factors can be also interconnected. Mobile phone data have recently offered a pervasive and ubiquitous opportunity to sense individual behavior in many aspects of daily life. The past few years have seen an increasing interest in the use of Call Detail Records (CDRs), i.e. georeferenced data obtained from cell phones that track individual trajectories over time.
