Controlling  and containing epidemics is an important healthcare challenge worldwide. Nowadays, people easily can move from different countries and human fluxes are coming increasingly complex and heterogeneous, it makes easier the propagations of pathogens all over the world. In this scenario, approaches that can surveille subpopulations movement are critical for enhancing containment and mitigation processes. Modeling epidemic diffusion for unraveling the features that are involved in the epidemic spreading is an ever-evolving challenge. It been proved that population structures, mobility and social interactions are the key drivers of the epidemics and this factors can be also interconnected.  This kind of informations , especially in less developed countries, are not to easy to collect. 


Mobile phone data have recently offered a pervasive and ubiquitous opportunity to sense individual behavior in many aspects of daily life.  The past few years have seen an increasing interest in the use of Call Detail Records (CDRs), i.e. georeferenced data obtained from cell phones that track individual trajectories over time.  Mobile phones have been one of the fastest growing technologies over the last decade, reaching urban and rural populations across all over the world. CDRs provids extremely rich information on individuals’ displacements and communication activities. They have proven to be extremely useful in research studies turning these data into actionable information and identified as a critical element to support global and sustainable development. Such data have been widely used to characterize individual patterns of mobility and were recently integrated into metapopulation models to understand the spread of infectious disease epidemic, such as e. g. malaria or cholera epidemics.
