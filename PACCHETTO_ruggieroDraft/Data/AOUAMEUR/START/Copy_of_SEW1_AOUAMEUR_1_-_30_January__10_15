Compose different


Recent research in AI-assisted music tools is opening new horizons for art creation. For example, a computer is able, on the one hand, to extract features from a sound and to learn notions such as structure, genre or even rythm by learning on huge corpuses of existing sound pieces.  Such systems are already widespread in companies for music analysis tasks such as mood detection, lyrics and melody transcription and many others. Therefore, some music supervision companies are now shelving their expertise in music listening to rely on such tools to help them categorize sounds.


Generation with AI


On the other hand, similar systems are also able to model music sequences and to generate new ones using a corpus to learn harmony, chord progressions or timbre. However, unlike the former application, the perspective of using AI based assistants for melodic composition can still be perceived as cheating by old school composers with a strong musical background. Indeed, we actually use machines to extract the essence of music from a huge collection of existing tracks, while c Composing music is a constantly evolving process. Indeed, from tribal percussions and rhythms to elkectronic dance music, composers have came a long way.
