The advances on genotipyng techniques and molecular testing are increasingly pointing out the strong heterogeneities characterizing pathogens circulating in a host population.
Different pathogens co-circulate and pathogens are structured in multiple strains with novel genetic and phenotypic variants continuously emerging getting established in the population and then getting extinct. This population structure has a profound impact on the epidemiology of infectious diseases in many cases.
In particular strain diversity and the emergence of a new strain has important implications for disease containment and eradication since it affects the effectiveness of vaccination and the mergence of resistant variants.
 
The factors affecting the emergence of a new strain represent a critical issue. On one hand strain epidemiological traits are important determinants of the replacement/extinction outcomes on the other it was shown that features of human population play an important role in shaping the probability of replenishment.
 
Theoretical studies suggest that the topology of the host interaction network is shaping the phase space of replacement/ extinction outcomes, with heterogeneous networks reducing the chance of persistence in the population.  For the case of influenza the timing of emergence was found to be a driver of the chance of emergence.
