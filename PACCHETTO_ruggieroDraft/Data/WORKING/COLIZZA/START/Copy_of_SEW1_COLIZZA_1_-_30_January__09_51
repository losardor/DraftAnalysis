Intro for paper on nosocomial risk


* Importance of HAI, burden, costs, AMR
* Importance of contacts inside the hospital, role of HCWs, role of nurses
* Infection control interventions targeting nurses as a group: hygiene (hand washing), masks, vaccination. Intervention on contacts? Peripatetic HCWs, rewiring of contacts. Removing contacts not feasible because quality of care
* Present study: reorganization of contacts through reorganization of working shifts of nurses, change schedule by maintaining some constraints (workload, shift duration, etc.). Aim: reduction of nosocomial risk


Healthcare associated infections (HAI) are increasingly widespread with an estimated 4 million individuals affected each year in Europe, representing approximately 6% of hospitalized patients [ref]. These infections have a substantial impact on morbidity and associated costs for the health-care system, potentially leading to failure of treatment, longer illnesses, and deaths. In addition, the rise of antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial pathogens
