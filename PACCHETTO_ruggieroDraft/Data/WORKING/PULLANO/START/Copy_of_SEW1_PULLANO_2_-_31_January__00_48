Infectious diseases are the second leading cause of death in the world, in the history many times people from over the world have been affected by devastating epidemic that had destroyed both the social and economic environment. Therefore, controlling and containing the epidemic diffusion is an important  healthcare challenge worldwide.  


Public Health institutions needs to plan and evaluate targeting strategies to prevent or contain outbreaks, a key role is played by modeling the epidemic spreading. In fact  identify the key mechanisms of the epidemic propagation is an ever-evolving challenge.  The principal drivers of the epidemic spreading are the subpopulations structures ( e.i. geography or social structures), the human mobility and social interactions. Nowadays, by the increasing of the transport network, especially  air network,  people moves easier all over the world. It involves  more complexity in individual fluxes and it means that understanding the spatial and temporal propagation of pathogens is becoming always more complicated. 
Additionally, collecting informations about human behaviors, it is not that easy, especially in developing countries where the mobility is highly heterogeneous. 


Mobile phone data has recently offer the opportunity to sense individual behaviours in many aspect of daily life. It have been one of the fastest technologies over the last decade, reaching both urban and rural populations. Mobile phone data are collected by telephone companies every time that an user make a call or text a message.
