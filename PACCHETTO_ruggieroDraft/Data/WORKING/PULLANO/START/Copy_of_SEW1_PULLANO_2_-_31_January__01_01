Therefore, controlling and containing the epidemic diffusion is an important  healthcare challenge worldwide.  


Nowadays, by the increasing of the travels and urbanization,  people moves easier and more frequently. It involves  more complexity in individual fluxes and more difficult on the understanding of the spatial and temporal propagation of pathogens is becoming always. 


Public Health institutions needs to plan and evaluate targeting strategies to prevent or contain outbreaks, especially


 in this case a  key role is played by the modelisation of the epidemic spreading. In fact, modeling the diffusion process behind an outbreak allows to  identify the key mechanisms of the spread. It was proven that principal drivers of the epidemic spreading are the subpopulations structures ( e.i. geography or social structures), the human mobility and  the social interactions. 
Additionally, collecting informations about human behaviors, it is not that easy, especially in developing countries where the mobility is highly heterogeneous. 


Mobile phone data has recently offer the opportunity to sense individual behaviours in many aspect of daily life.
