The emergence of antibiotic resistance and the need of evolutionary-proof drugs


The beginning of the 20th century marked the onset of the antibiotics era. 
The invention of antibiotics represented a true revolution as many fatal and common infections could then be cured, reducing the overall burden on public health.
 
However, it did not take a long time since the appearance of the first antibiotic drugs for bacteria to strike back: as antibiotics became a common practice in medical settings, some bacterial species “developed” their own counter-measures, becoming more resilient to human-made drugs. 
An arms race to find new and efficient antibiotics to outsmart resistant bacteria then started. 
Nowadays, several lines of antibiotics are available in most hospitals; however, evidence for infections resilient even to last line drugs has been reported.
It is now clear that an universal panacea does not exist and that, sooner or later, any antibiotics will become obsolete.
Also, the frequency at which new drugs are being developed and distributed to the large public is decreasing.


In the urge of fighting antibiotic resistance, researchers have been recently looking at “evolutionary-proof” drugs, whose aim is to maximally delay the onset of resistance in bacterial populations.
