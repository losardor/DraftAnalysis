Aim: Develop knowledge on care pathways of persons with MS to enhance care consumption.


Since its first definition, the concept of care pathway has provoked a great interest worldwide, especially in France. This notion aims at defining the successive use of the right care resources for each patient at the best time. Usually defined for a given disease, especially a chronic disease in France, this concept mostly remains theoretical and must be based on data issued from observational studies.However, there is still a lack of data on care consumption for some diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Therefore, there is currently a need for the development of studies in France on this specific subject to develop knowledge on care pathways of persons with MS (PwMS).


Firstly, a better knowledge of these pathways may be useful in order to have a better characterization of the use of care resources


Argument 1: Better knowledge → Less care consumption → Economical benefit
Argument 2: Better knowledge → Better care so less adverse events
Argument 3: Better knowledge → better characterization and identify needs and thus unmet needs
Argument 4: Better knowledge → target specific research questions to develop afterwards (treatments, paramedical care)
Argument 5: Better knowledge → Best care to people
