The last decades have witnessed the emergence of complex network science as a powerful and versatile framework. Its applications span are diverse, and span different fields, like neuroscience, social sciences, epidemiology, finance. By representing a system in terms of agents (nodes) and relationships among them (links) scientists can use tools inherited from physics, mathematics and computer science, and uncover emergent properties previously overlooked.
Network science finds applications beyond ‘hard sciences’, as, for instance, history. The historical evolution of many institutions can be represented in terms of relationships among agents. The main drawback is, however, that reliable, unbiased records are often missing, or hidden in ancient volumes. Thanks to recent digitization efforts, that might be about to change.
In this work, we study the evolution of one of the most
