The need for AI based interactive tools for music composition




Nowadays, artificial intelligence has opened exciting perspectives in various domains such as artistic creation. Indeed, we have now reached a point where machine learning models are able of producing realistic and touching work of art as shown by the example of The Next Rembrandt, a project led by Delft university aiming at creating a totally new painting in the style of the famous Dutch painter with the help of AI. While being increasingly used for visual art, music is still lacking that new technologic layer.


However, musicians and composers are not stranger to change since they came a long way from the tribal rhythms, gregorian chants or middle age musical stories. At that time, musical traditions were transmitted orally, which is not the case anymore since the development of theories on how to write music. These have been led the way for newer ways to compose, providing the ability to create more complex pieces while ensuring their reproducibility. Our generation has now to address how to incorporate the new paradigm of machine learning into music creation.


While research is hence being conducted on AI tools for music composition, some experienced composer might be questioning both the relevance and the morality of such tools. Indeed, computers being logic machines deprived from feelings, they have the incredible ability to extract music theory as mathematical structures out of huge corpuses of existing pieces. This raises two important questions: should AI-based tools be perceived as stealing the work of human composers and are they able to generate “artistic” pieces.


A track for answering the first question is that currently developed
