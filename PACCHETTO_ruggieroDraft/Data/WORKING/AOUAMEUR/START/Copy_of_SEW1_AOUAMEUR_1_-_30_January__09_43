In the early '80s, the invention of the digital sampler revolutionized the way drums are produced: besides hiring a professional drummer, music producers have since been given the choice to compose drum tracks with synthesized drum sounds. At that time where synthesizers were very popular, this has led to more freedom in drum sounds design. Today, many producers still rely on drum samplers especially since the internet provides access to huge libraries of samples that can be downloaded and used easily. This has helped music production to become increasingly accessible to inexperienced newcomers but this can also be seen as hampering the creative process of crafting new sounds. Indeed, to find sounds, producers can now browse their huge collection of samples (a very inefficient task), rely on a restricted selection (which actually hampers creativity) or they still can synthesize their own drums but the sound design process has become increasingly complete and complex given the overwhelming amount of parameters provided by modern synthesizers. This casts the light on the crucial trade-off between \emph{control richness} and \emph{ease of use}. Therefore, a method allowing easy and rich exploration of sounds becomes a key requirement in music production, especially for non-expert users. Thus, numerous research efforts have been done in the domain of user experience in order to provide interfaces that enhance the fluidity of human-machine interactions.
