Chopping Down the Syntax Tree 
(version 2)


For more than half a century, Noam Chomsky has dominated the field of linguistics. In his view, the human language faculty is a “perfect system” that interfaces with our conceptual-intentional system (which we need for assigning meaning to sentences) and with our sensori-motor system (which we need for articulating and perceiving sentences). This view has now

If Noam Chomsky’s Visiting Martian would travel back to earth to catch up with the latest developments in linguistics, they would be intrigued by a new species of language researchers: construction grammarians. Construction grammarians come in all shapes and sizes, but they all agree that all linguistic information can be represented by a single data structure: constructions. 




This idea revolutionizes how we conceive of the human language faculty: 




no more separation between words and syntax, no more distinction between rules and exceptions, and no more need to split up language into different mental modules. But what exactly is a construction and what can it do?


A first striking observation is that construction grammarians tend to avoid tree diagrams for analyzing the structure of sentences that other linguists love so much.
