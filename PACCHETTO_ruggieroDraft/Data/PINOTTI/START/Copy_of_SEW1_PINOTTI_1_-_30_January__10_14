The Emergence of Antibiotic Resistance in bacteria


The beginning of the 20th century marked the onset of the antibiotics era. 
The invention of antibiotics represented a true revolution as many fatal and common infections could then be cured, reducing the overall burden on public health.
 
However, it did not take a long time since the appearance of the first antibiotic drugs for bacteria to strike back: as antibiotics became a common practice in medical settings, some bacterial species “developed” their own counter-measures, becoming more resilient to human-made drugs. 


An arms race to find new antibiotics started
It is now clear that an universal panacea does not exist and that, sooner or later, any antibiotics will become obsolete.
