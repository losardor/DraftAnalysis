Intro for paper on nosocomial risk


* Importance of HAI, burden, costs, AMR
* Importance of contacts inside the hospital, role of HCWs, role of nurses
* Infection control interventions targeting nurses as a group: hygiene (hand washing), masks, vaccination. Intervention on contacts? Peripatetic HCWs, rewiring of contacts. Removing contacts not feasible because quality of care
* Present study: reorganization of contacts through reorganization of working shifts of nurses, change schedule by maintaining some constraints (workload, shift duration, etc.). Aim: reduction of nosocomial risk


Healthcare associated infections (HAI) are increasingly widespread with an estimated 4 million individuals affected each year in Europe, representing approximately 6% of hospitalized patients [refs]. These infections have a substantial impact on morbidity and associated costs for the health-care system, potentially leading to failure of treatment, longer illnesses, and deaths. In addition, the rise of antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial pathogens have dramatically increased the threat posed by these infections, as they me at the origin of serious infections that cannot be treated with available drugs [refs].  


Common bacterial pathogens generally spread through close-range proximity or physical contacts between individuals. Several studies highlighted the importance of contacts in the hospital setting, showing how a larger variety of contacts and longer durations increase the risk for nosocomial infection [refs].
