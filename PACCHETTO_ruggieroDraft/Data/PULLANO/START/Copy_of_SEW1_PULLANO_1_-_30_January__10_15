Controlling  and containing epidemics is an important healthcare challenge worldwide. Nowadays people easily can move from different countries, leading that human fluxes are coming increasingly complex and heterogeneous, it makes easier the propagations of pathogens.In this scenario, approaches that can surveille subpopulations movement are critical for enhancing containment and mitigation processes. Modeling epidemic diffusion in order to underline the key features that are involved in the epidemic spreading is an ever-evolving challenge.


The past few years have seen an increasing interest in the use of Call Detail Records (CDRs), i.e. georeferenced data obtained from cell phones that track individual trajectories over time. 


Nowadays mobile phone data is a technologies that reach countries all over the world,
