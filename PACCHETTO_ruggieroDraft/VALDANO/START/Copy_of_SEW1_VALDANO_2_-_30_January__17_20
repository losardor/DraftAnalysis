Complex networks have fostered scientific progress in many fields, like neuroscience, economics, epidemiology, ecology, sociology. Their scope of application now stretches to the humanities, where they can uncover emergent properties that would escape traditional qualitative approaches. A lack of large, comprehensive datasets, however, still hurdles widespread application of quantitative methods, and specifically network theory, to disciplines beyond linguistics.


A promising field which could benefit from network theory is history, through the analysis of large-scale historical records.
